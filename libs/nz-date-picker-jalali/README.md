> More information about `@angular/cli` [here](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

You can also install `ng-zorro-antd` with npm or yarn,
Then install `nz-date-picker-jalali` with npm or yarn for Jalali

```bash

```


## Provide custom DateAdapter
If you need to present another calendar like [Jalali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalali_calendar) or [Hijri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_calendar), you can provide a custom NzDateAdapter which implements required methods to deal with native date object.

### Example
```ts
import { NzDateAdapter } from 'nz-date-picker-jalali';

export class CustomDateAdapter extends NzDateAdapter<any> {
    // implementation of abstract methods
}

@NgModule({
  providers: [
    {provide: NzDateAdapter, useClass: CustomDateAdapter}
  ]
})
export class AppModule {}
```
